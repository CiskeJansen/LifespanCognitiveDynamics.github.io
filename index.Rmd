In the Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics lab we are interested how, and why, cognitive abilities change across the lifespan. Based at the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) in Nijmegen and the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/), we are especially interested in changes, and differences, in fluid abilities such as abstract reasoning. To study these questions we use a range of multivariate methods in large samples to examine how cognitive abilities affect each other, how brain structure and function supports changes in cognitive abilities, and how cognitive functioning interfaces with lifestyle factors such as physical and mental health, social and intellectual engagement and environmental factors. Our research is supported by the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the European Union.
