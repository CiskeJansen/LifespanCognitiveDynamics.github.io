## New lab preprints using the ABCD sample

12/03/2023 
Two new lab preprints, both on the ABCD sample. Lea Michel examines the complementary prediction of grey and white matter, as well as distinct metrics within each in predicting cognitive performance https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.06.529634v1.article-metrics
Sam Parsons uses novel tools of reliability decomposition to show differences in longitudinal stability/reliability across brain regions, structural measures (cortical thickness in particular), scanner types and ABCD testing sites.
